## Server Setup

### AWS Configuration

#### 1. Configure AWS CLI

Add the following to `~/.aws/config`:
```ini
[default]
region = us-east-1
output = json
```

#### 2. Set Up AWS Credentials

1. Create an IAM role in AWS Console
2. Generate access keys
3. Add the following to `~/.aws/credentials`:
```ini
aws_access_key_id = your-secret-id
aws_secret_access_key = your-secret-access-key
```

### Infrastructure Setup

#### S3 Bucket Setup

1. Create a generic S3 bucket in AWS Console:
   - Use default configurations
   - Note down the bucket name for later use

#### Terraform Configuration

1. Copy `terraform.example` to `terraform.tfvars`:
   ```bash
   cp terraform.example terraform.tfvars
   ```

2. Update `terraform.tfvars` with your configuration:
   - Add your S3 bucket name
   - Set other required environment variables
   - Add your secrets

### Deployment

#### Build and Deploy

1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   sh ./build.sh
   ```

This will:
- Deploy Lambda functions
- Set up API Gateway routes
- Configure environment variables
- Store API key in AWS Secrets Manager

#### Environment Variables

The following are stored as Lambda environment variables:
- S3 bucket name
- Client domain
- Other configuration values

### Cleanup

To remove all deployed resources:

1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Run Terraform destroy:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

This will remove:
- Lambda functions
- API Gateway routes
- Associated triggers

Note: The S3 bucket must be manually deleted from the AWS Console.

## Testing WebSocket Connections

The application uses WebSocket connections for real-time updates. Here's how to test the WebSocket functionality:

### Prerequisites for WebSocket Testing

1. Deploy the application to AWS
2. Note down your API Gateway WebSocket URL (format: `wss://xxxxx.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/stage`)
3. Ensure the following environment variables are set in your Lambda functions:
   - `api_key_value`: Your API key for authentication
   - `CONNECTIONS_TABLE`: Your DynamoDB table name for storing connections

### Testing Steps

1. **Install WebSocket Client**
   ```bash
   npm install -g wscat
   ```

2. **Connect to WebSocket**
   ```bash
   wscat -c "wss://your-api-gateway-url.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/stage?apiKey=your-api-key"
   ```

3. **Verify Connection in DynamoDB**
   - Go to AWS Console â†’ DynamoDB
   - Select your connections table
   - You should see a new item with the connection ID
   - The item should be removed when you disconnect

4. **Test Disconnection**
   - Press Ctrl+C in the wscat terminal to disconnect
   - Verify in DynamoDB that the connection record is removed

### Expected Behavior

- Successful connection: You'll see a connection established message
- Invalid API key: Connection will be rejected with a 403 error
- Missing API key: Connection will be rejected with a 401 error
- After disconnection: The connection record should be removed from DynamoDB
